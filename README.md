**Regression Models - Linear and Polynomial**<br>

*This project demonstrates the use of different regression techniques to fit a model to a dataset. It covers:*

Linear Regression (Single Variable): Fits a straight line to the data with a single feature.
Linear Regression (Multiple Variables): Fits a hyperplane to the data with multiple features.
Polynomial Regression (Single Variable): Fits a polynomial curve to the data.
Pipeline for Polynomial Scaling and Linear Regression: Demonstrates how to scale features and use linear regression in a pipeline for polynomial regression.
Additionally, the project evaluates the performance of each regression model using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²).

**Features**
Linear Regression (Single Variable): A model with one feature.
Linear Regression (Multiple Variables): A model with more than one feature.
Polynomial Regression (Single Variable): A model that fits a polynomial curve to data.
Pipeline for Polynomial Scaling: A pipeline that integrates polynomial feature scaling and linear regression.
Performance Evaluation: Evaluation of the regression models based on MSE and R² score.
