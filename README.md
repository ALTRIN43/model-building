**Regression Models - Linear and Polynomial**<br>
<br>
*This project demonstrates the use of different regression techniques to fit a model to a dataset. It covers:*<br>
<br>
Linear Regression (Single Variable): Fits a straight line to the data with a single feature.<br>
Linear Regression (Multiple Variables): Fits a hyperplane to the data with multiple features.<br>
Polynomial Regression (Single Variable): Fits a polynomial curve to the data.<br>
Pipeline for Polynomial Scaling and Linear Regression: Demonstrates how to scale features and use linear regression in a pipeline for polynomial regression.<br>
Additionally, the project evaluates the performance of each regression model using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²).<br>
<br>
**Features:**<br>
<br>
Linear Regression (Single Variable): A model with one feature.<br>
Linear Regression (Multiple Variables): A model with more than one feature.<br>
Polynomial Regression (Single Variable): A model that fits a polynomial curve to data.<br>
Pipeline for Polynomial Scaling: A pipeline that integrates polynomial feature scaling and linear regression.<br>
Performance Evaluation: Evaluation of the regression models based on MSE and R² score.<br>
